Hi. For whoever reading this message in the future.

The reason I'm trying to re-learn everything I know after almost half a year being a Full stack Developer with a few projects, I realized that I still have more things I don't know how to do or rather how to do it right. And constantly in a state of questioning my ability and knowledge about everything I learned over the past year.

Some people call it "Impostor Syndrome". Whether it is the correct term or not, I honestly don't know. I just want to be a better person and developer. For that reason, I am currently re-learning what I already know, in hope to be able to improve myself.

The platform I use for it is [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The course is long and each section has detailed information about the subject. Sometime I struggle to keep my motivation up, especially since most of it is the uninteresting part of reading a long paragraph of text. At the moment I'm writing this, I don't have a good solution to break free from this. What sometime works is I take a break and trying to free my mind from it until I feel less stressed out about the fact that my journey is just started. And my knowledge I built up until this point might also be a hurdle, since I'm constantly reminded that my understanding about the subject is incorrect and need to remove the bias in understanding.

## The tech I know so far as a Web Developer
- HTML
- CSS (mostly Tailwind CSS)
- Javascript
- Typescript
- React
- Version Control using Git
- Github

## Good habit that I have to apply
- Atomic commit
- Good commit message
- Try to breakdown whatever bothering my mind so I can release some weight to help me be better at learning
